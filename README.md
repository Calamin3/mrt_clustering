# LTA MRT Clustering 

In Singapore, one of the main forms of public transportation is via MRT/LRT. One assignment that I have performed is to use the commuting data for MRT and employ appropriate cluster analysis methods to group these stations into homogeneous groups using the origin-destination data. We are interested to find out the weekday AM (7-9am) and PM peak (5-7pm) for the journey-to-work and journey-to-home trips, and for weekend interaction during noon times (11-1pm).
